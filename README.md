This is the Jekyll based Clarity Hub website.

## Getting Started

If you want to use the Jekyll command line locally, you will need to install jekyll and bunder. You may need to `sudo` this command:

```
gem install jekyll bundler
```

## Tips

⚠️ The website uses Instant click, which means:

> Links to index.html files MUST end in a trailing slash, ie: `/register/`
